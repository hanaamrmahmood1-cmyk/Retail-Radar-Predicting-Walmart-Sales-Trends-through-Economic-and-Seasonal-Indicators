Retail Radar: Walmart Sales ForecastingProject DescriptionRetail Radar is a predictive analytics project designed to forecast weekly sales for 45 Walmart locations. The project focuses on identifying the influence of macroeconomic indicators and seasonal cycles on retail volume. A key highlight of this analysis is the "Tandem Duo"—the strong positive correlation between Fuel Prices and the Consumer Price Index (CPI)—and its role in defining the store's economic environment.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)The EDA phase was conducted to validate the following insights:The Economic Squeeze: Confirmed a linear correlation between Fuel Prices and CPI, indicating that these factors move in tandem to impact consumer purchasing power.Holiday Volatility: Identified significant "Turbo Spikes" in revenue during specific holiday weeks (Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas).Temperature Sensitivity: Revealed a non-linear (bell-curve) relationship between local temperature and sales, where extreme weather conditions correlate with decreased store traffic.Technical Implementation1. Data PreprocessingTo prepare the data for machine learning, the following steps were performed:Feature Engineering: Extracted Year, Month, and Week from the raw Date column to capture seasonal patterns.Categorical Encoding: Applied One-Hot Encoding to the Store IDs to treat each of the 45 locations as a distinct entity.Feature Scaling: Utilized StandardScaler to normalize economic variables (Fuel Price, CPI, Unemployment, and Temperature), ensuring all features are on a comparable scale for the model.2. Machine Learning ModelsTwo high-performance ensemble models were implemented and compared:Random Forest Regressor: Selected for its stability and ability to handle the non-linear "Bell Curve" of temperature and sudden holiday spikes.XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting): Implemented to optimize the prediction of the "Tandem Duo" relationship by iteratively correcting errors in the economic trend lines.Evaluation MetricsThe models were evaluated based on the following:R-squared ($R^2$): To measure the proportion of variance explained by the economic and seasonal features.Mean Absolute Error (MAE): To quantify the average dollar-amount deviation of predictions from actual weekly sales.RequirementsPython 3.xPandasScikit-LearnXGBoostMatplotlibSeaborn
